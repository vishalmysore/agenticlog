# **Google A2A AgenticLog - AI-Driven Log Processing**

## **Overview**
Google A2A AgenticLog is an intelligent logging system that leverages Google A2A protocol and AI agent to **automatically process log messages** and take appropriate actions based on their context. Instead of relying on static rule-based processing, it uses an **agentic approach** to dynamically route logs to the correct handlers.  
A2AJava is the Java implementation of the Google A2A protocol you can check the project [here](https://github.com/vishalmysore/a2ajav) .

## **How It Works**
1. **Log messages are captured** using a custom appender.
2. **A2A Appender** sends the log messages to a designated A2A server.
3**AI processes the log content** and determines the best action to take.
4. **Actions are executed dynamically** based on the extracted intent from the logs.

For example:

``` logger.error("ERROR customer-support error, customer ID 12345, query: \"What is the status of my order?\""); ```

The AI detects a customer inquiry and call

``` createSupportTicket(customerId, query) ```

If the log contains an escalation request

``` escalateIssue(errorMessage) ```
